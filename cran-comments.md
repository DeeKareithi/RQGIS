## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* replaced in the Description section "Package RQGIS establishes an interface..." by "Establishes an interface...".
* omitted "RQGIS: " from the title.
* single-quoted software names in the Description section of the DESCRIPTION file.
* added a web-reference (<http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>) to the QGIS software in the DESCRIPTION file and put the url inside <...>.
  
## Test environments
* local Windows installation, R 3.3.2 and win-builder (devel)
* local Ubuntu 16.04 installation, R 3.3.2
* local OS X installation, R 3.3.2

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of RQGIS. No ERRORs or WARNINGs were reported.
